# calculator-javascript
This is a project to fix the knowledge of CSS, HTML and JS running togheter.
Have best ways to do this code, but I try to follow the instructions of the course that i'm doing
and only use functions that are shown to me until now.
I added more things than the course wants, but this not affect their conditions.
